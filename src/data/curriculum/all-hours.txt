2. Teacher Talking Points & Scripts

??? Opening Script (5 minutes)
“Welcome back, young SkillPreneurz!
Last time, we learned what entrepreneurs are.
Today, we learn how entrepreneurs find great ideas.
Every successful idea begins with a problem. So today, we’re going to become Idea Detectives!
Entrepreneurs don’t wait for ideas—they discover them by observing people and places around them. And we’ll use a special tool called S.E.E.R. to help us.”
Ask children:
* “What is one small problem you noticed today?”
* “What annoyed you, confused you, or slowed you down?”
* “Do problems only mean bad things?” (Answer: No, they are opportunities!)

?? Storytelling Section (10 minutes)
? Story: “Mia the Problem Spotter”
Mia was an 11-year-old who loved puzzles. One day at school, she noticed something interesting:
• Kids waited a long time to fill their water bottles.
• Many lost their pencils every week.
• The playground slide was always too hot in summer.
Mia didn’t ignore these. She wrote them all in her “Problem Notebook.”
That evening, she asked herself:
“Which problem affects the most people? Which one really matters?”
She realized kids were always thirsty because the water line was too slow. So Mia suggested adding a second tap — and even drew a simple design!
Her idea solved a real problem because she spotted it, explored who faced it, evaluated its importance, and refined one opportunity.
Need: Something important that people must have.
Example: Example: Clean water, healthy food.
Want: Something nice to have, but not necessary.
Example: Example: Ice cream, video games.

She used the S.E.E.R. framework without even knowing it!
Teacher Prompts:
* “What did Mia Spot?”
* “Who faced the problem she found?”
* “Why did she choose one problem over others?”
* “Was she being an entrepreneur?”

?? Concept Teaching (10 minutes)

Introduction to Topic
In this session, students learn one of the most powerful tools in entrepreneurship — knowing your customer.
Kids often jump to ideas without understanding who they are helping and what the person really needs. This session teaches them how real innovators think: by listening, observing, asking questions, and understanding emotions.
Using the H.E.A.R.T. framework, students will learn how to connect deeply with the people they want to help. They’ll practice empathy, a core life and leadership skill, through stories, role-play, and simple conversations.
This hour strengthens listening, emotional intelligence, observation skills, curiosity, and early user research skills.

?? Learning Outcomes (Kid-Friendly Phrasing)
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
* Listen carefully to someone’s story or difficulty.
* Understand how the person feels and why they feel that way.
* Ask open-ended questions that help reveal real needs.

2. Teacher Talking Points & Scripts

??? Opening Script (5 minutes)
“Welcome, young innovators!
Today, we learn the superpower that all great entrepreneurs use — understanding your customer’s heart.
Before building anything — a game, a product, or a service — you must first understand who you are helping and what they feel.
Entrepreneurs are not just problem solvers. They are people understanders.
We will use a special tool called H.E.A.R.T. that helps us listen, feel, and understand better.”
Ask kids:
* “Has anyone ever listened to you when you felt upset?”
* “How did it feel when someone understood you?”
* “Do you think entrepreneurs should have big hearts?”

?? Storytelling Section (10 minutes)
? Story: “Mia the Heartful Listener”
Mia  was great at making fun crafts, but one day she wanted to help her classmates study better.
She thought of making colorful notes… but then she paused.
Instead of guessing, she asked her friend Alex,
“Can you tell me what’s difficult for you while studying?”
Alex said softly,
“Sometimes I feel lost… I don’t know where to start.”
Mia listened carefully. She didn’t interrupt. She noticed he looked stressed.
She asked,
“What makes you feel that way?”
He replied, “There are too many chapters… I get confused.”
Mia thought,
“It’s not about colorful notes… Alex needs help becoming organized.”
So she made a simple “Study Starter Sheet” instead — with 3 steps:
1. What to read first
2. What to read next
3. Where to write doubts
Alex loved it!
Mia didn’t just make something cute. She made something useful — because she listened with H.E.A.R.T.
Teacher Prompts:
* “Which steps of H.E.A.R.T. did Riya use?”
* “How did she show empathy?”
* “What did she learn by asking questions?”

??? Opening Script (5 minutes)
“Welcome back, inventors!
Today is one of the most fun sessions — we become creators of ideas.
Every invention you see — iPhones, roller skates, fidget spinners — came from someone’s imagination.
But creativity isn’t magic. It’s a skill. And today we’ll learn a framework called S.C.A.P.E. that helps you think in many directions.
We’re not judging ideas today — we’re collecting them like treasure!”
Ask kids:
* “What is the craziest idea you’ve ever thought of?”
* “Have you ever wished something worked differently?”
* “Do you like imagining impossible things?”

?? Storytelling Section (10 minutes)
? Story: “Karo the Idea Maker”
Karo loved solving puzzles, but he often got stuck when thinking of ideas for school projects.
One day, Karo wanted to improve school lunchboxes. He knew kids complained about:
* Food getting cold
* Spilling
* Forgetting spoons
So he used S.C.A.P.E. to generate ideas:
1. Substitute:
“What if instead of plastic, lunchboxes were made of soft, warm fabric?”
2. Combine:
“What if we mix a lunchbox + mini heater = warm lunchbox?”
3. Adapt:
“What if younger kids had easier-to-open lids?”
4. Put to another use:
“What if the lunchbox could become a snack tray too?”
5. Eliminate:
“Can we remove the need to carry a spoon by adding a foldable spoon built in?”
Karo didn’t choose just one — but S.C.A.P.E. helped him think of many possibilities.
That’s the magic of creativity.
Teacher Prompts:
* “Which part of S.C.A.P.E. did Karo use best?”
* “What did Karo substitute?”
* “Which idea could really work in real life?”

Worksheet Template for Teacher – Hour 5

Introduction to Topic
This hour helps students turn their ideas into something real — a prototype!
A prototype is a simple, basic version of an idea that helps you understand what works and what doesn’t. In entrepreneurship, we call this the MVP – Minimum Viable Product.
Students will learn that:
* Ideas become clearer when you build something.
* Prototypes don’t have to be perfect; they only need to show how the idea works.
* Feedback from others helps improve ideas.
* Making, testing, fixing, and showcasing is an essential entrepreneurial cycle.
Using the C.R.E.A.T.E. framework, students will build, test, reflect, and refine their prototypes.
This hour fosters creativity, problem-solving, teamwork, resilience, and iteration mindset.

?? Learning Outcomes (Kid-Friendly Phrasing)
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
* Turn their idea into a simple model, drawing, or demo.
* Test their prototype with friends.
* Ask good questions to collect helpful feedback.
* Understand what people liked or didn’t like.
* Make improvements (tweaks!) based on feedback.
* Present their updated idea confidently.

??? Opening Script (5 minutes)
“Welcome back, creators! Today is one of the most exciting days — the day where your ideas come to life!
We are going to build prototypes — simple versions of your ideas. They don’t have to be perfect. They just need to show what your idea looks like or how it works.
Entrepreneurs learn by doing. We build, test, fix, and build again.
And we have a special tool for that: C.R.E.A.T.E.
This is how real inventors work!”
Ask students:
* “Have you ever built something from scratch?”
* “Have you tried making something, failed, and then improved it?”
* “Does building help you think better?”

?? Storytelling Section (10 minutes)
? Story: “Sara’s Super Snack Machine MVP”
Sara wanted to help kids get quick snacks during short breaks. Her idea: a Super Snack Machine that gives healthy snacks automatically.
But she didn’t know how to build a real machine yet — so she made a prototype.
She used:
* A shoebox
* Paper buttons
* Slots for snack choices
* A pretend “coin insert”
C – Craft: She built a paper model showing how it works.
R – Run: She asked her classmates to “use it.”
E – Engage: She asked:
* “What snack would you pick?”
* “Is the button clear?”
* “Does the slot make sense?"
A – Assess: She learned:
* Kids wanted more snack options.
* Buttons should be bigger.
* The box needed a small tray.
T – Tweak: She improved it by adjusting buttons & adding more slots.
E – Exhibit: She presented it during assembly — and everyone cheered!
Sara wasn’t building a real machine yet.
She was testing the idea — like a true entrepreneur.
Teacher Prompt:
* “Why didn’t Sara build the real machine first?”
* “What did she learn from her testers?”
* “What step of C.R.E.A.T.E. do you find most important?”

2. Teacher Talking Points & Scripts

??? Opening Script (5 minutes)
“Welcome, young money-smart entrepreneurs!
Today, you will learn how to think like a business owner when it comes to money.
Every successful idea needs two things:
? A good plan
? Smart money decisions
But don’t worry — you don’t need big math skills.
Just curiosity, honesty, and the C.O.S.T. framework, which we will learn today!”
Ask students:
* “Have you ever saved money for something special?”
* “Have you ever planned a small sale or fundraising activity?”
* “Why do you think entrepreneurs must understand money?”

?? Storytelling Section (10 minutes)
? Story: “Aanya’s Cookie Cart Budget”
Aanya loved baking cookies. She wanted to sell them during her school sports day.
But before she started, her mom said,
“Every entrepreneur needs a budget!”
So Aanya used C.O.S.T.
1. C – Calculate
She made a list:
* Flour: ?40
* Butter: ?80
* Chocolate chips: ?60
Total ingredients cost = ?180
She could make 20 cookies.
Cost per cookie = ?9
2. O – Offer
“How much should I sell each cookie for?”
She decided: ?15 per cookie —
fair for students, with some profit for her.
3. S – Save & Share
If she sells all 20 cookies:
Earning = 20 × ?15 = ?300
Profit = ?300 - ?180 = ?120
She planned to:
* Save ?60
* Spend ?40
* Share ?20 by buying snacks for two younger kids watching the games
4. T – Track
She kept a small notebook:
* Money In (sales)
* Money Out (ingredients)
* Profit
By the end of the event, Aanya realized:
“You don’t need to be grown up to be money-smart!”
Teacher Prompts:
* “How did Aanya calculate her costs?”
* “Was her selling price fair?”
* “Do you like how she shared her profit?”
* “What does tracking help with?”

He made a simple product: a Homework Helper Folder with color-coded sections.
But before sharing it with others, Arjun used S.P.E.A.K:
1. S – Show
Arjun explained the real problem simply:
“After sports practice, kids put all their worksheets together and things get wrinkled, lost, or mixed up.”
2. P – Promise
He shared the value of his solution:
“My folder keeps each subject in its own pocket, so homework stays safe and easy to find.”
3. E – Explain
He described exactly who needs it:
“It’s made for active students aged 8–12 who struggle to stay organized after school activities.”
4. A – Attract
Instead of just making posters, Arjun used practical ways to reach students:
He put a sample folder on the classroom notice board with labels showing the pockets.
He asked his teacher if he could show a 1-minute demo at the start of class.
He gave a free trial folder to 3 classmates and asked them to use it for a day.
5. K – Keep
He added helpful support:
He included a small “Care Card” inside each folder saying:
“If a pocket tears or you need extra labels, I’ll replace them for free.”
Soon, everyone knew his “Homework Helper Folder.”
Why?
Arjun communicated clearly using S.P.E.A.K.
